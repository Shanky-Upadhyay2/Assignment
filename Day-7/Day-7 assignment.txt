c.   How to delete all rows in a table except first row?
Ans. First, we create a table using <table> tag and add a button containing btn id. When a user clicks on the button,
     then the jQuery function is called. The jQuery function removes all the rows except the first one using the remove()
     method.
     $('#btn').click(function () {
     $("#rTable").find("tr:gt(0)").remove();
     });
