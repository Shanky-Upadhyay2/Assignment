Q3.  What is setInterval()  and setTimeout() methods in JavaScript?
Ans. The main difference between 'setTimeout' and 'setInterval' is that setTimeout executes the code only once after
     the specified delay, while setInterval executes the code repeatedly at the specified interval.

Q4.  What are promisees in JavaScript? Why do we use? 
Ans. A Promise is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. It allows you to
     associate handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure reason.
